Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting on it. The first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass times acceleration. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
